# V2X
Vehicle-to-everything (V2X) describes wireless communication between a vehicle and any entity that may affect, or may be affected by, the vehicle. Sometimes called C-V2X, it is a vehicular communication system that is intended to improve road safety and traffic efficiency while reducing pollution and saving energy.
There are two standards for dedicated V2X communications depending on the underlying wireless technology being used: (1) WLAN-based, and (2) cellular-based. V2X also incorporates various more specific types of communication including:

Vehicle-to-device (V2D) - Bluetooth / WiFi-Direct, e.g. Apple's CarPlay and Google's Android Auto.
Vehicle-to-grid (V2G) - information exchange with the smart grid to balance loads more efficiently.
Vehicle-to-building (V2B), also known as vehicle-to-home (V2H)
Vehicle-to-load (V2L)
Vehicle-to-network (V2N) - communication between a vehicle and a wider network, such as a cellular network. This category includes telematics, where a vehicle communicates with a fleet management platform or a cloud server.
Vehicle-to-cloud (V2C) - e.g. OTA updates, remote vehicle diagnostics (DoIP).
Vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) - e.g. traffic lights, lane markers and parking meters.
Vehicle-to-pedestrian (V2P) - e.g. wheelchairs and bicycles, commonly also used to designate vulnerable road users (VRUs).[6]
Vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) - real-time data exchange with nearby vehicles.
